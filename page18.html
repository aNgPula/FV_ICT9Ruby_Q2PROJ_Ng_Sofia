				<h2> Ingredients </h2>
				<ul> 
				<li>½ cup butter softened at room temperature</li>
				<li>½ cup vegetable or coconut oil</li>
				<li>1 cup sugar</li>
				<li>4 medium eggs at room temperature</li>
				<li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
				<li>2 teaspoons Ube extract/food color adjust if needed</li>
				<li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
				<li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
				<li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
				<li>1 cup milk</li>
				<li>¾ to 1 cup ube halaya or jam </li>
				<h3> Frosting </h3>
				<li>1 pack 200g cream cheese</li>
				<li>½ cup powdered sugar</li>
				<li>2 cups whipping/heavy cream</li>
				<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
				<li>Drops of ube extract/color</li>
				</ul>
				<br>

				<h2> Instructions </h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Make a pan release grease by combining the ingredients in a small bowl and mix using a whisk or fork until smooth. Grease the bottom and sides of an 8-inch (20 cm) round cake pan that is at least 3-inch high or use 2 pans. </li>
					<li>Preheat your oven to 300° F/150°C (conventional settings or no fan).</li>
					<li>In a mixing bowl, cream butter, oil, and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy (about 2-3 minutes).</li>
					<li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing them just until well blended after every addition. Then add the vanilla extract and ube food color or extract and mix.</li>
					<li>Sift in the flour, baking powder, and salt. (Do not mix yet). Pour in the milk on top of the dry ingredients and beat on medium-low speed just until combined. Do not overmix.</li>
					<li>Take about ½ cup of the batter and divide into 2 muffin molds lined with cupcake liners. You can also use and small baking dish or mold. Add ube jam to the remaining batter and beat until combined.</li>
					<li>Pour the remaining batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly. If using 2 pans then divide the batter equally. Tap the sides and bottom with your hand to let trapped air out, if any.</li>
					<li>Bake for 50 mins-1 hour in the preheated oven or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. If using 2 pans, it might be done in 20-30 minutes. The cupcakes will be done in 20-25 minutes. You can bake them together and just take out the cupcakes 20-25 minutes in.</li>
					<li>Let the cupcakes cool down a bit. Remove the liners and break it into chunks or crumbs using your hand. Then spread it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
					<li>Once cake is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before completely removing it from the pan to a cooling rack. Now, put the sheet of crumbs and bake for 15 minutes. Take it out and let it cool down completely. Transfer to a food processor/blender and pulse several times to turn it into fine crumbs.</li>
					<li>Once the cake has cooled down enough, cut the cake horizontally in half if using a single pan. Let it cook down completely. Refrigerate if you are in a hurry.</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Frosting</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Place the cream cheese and powdered sugar in a large bowl and beat on medium speed until smooth. Turn the mixer down to medium-low speed and pour the heavy cream down the side of the bowl in a very slow and steady stream, stopping every now and then to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl with a silicone spatula. When all the cream has been added, turn the mixer up to medium-high and whip until the frosting holds stiff peaks. Fold in the vanilla extract, if using, and mix using a spatula.</li>
					<li>Take 1 ½ to 2 cups of the frosting and transfer it into a piping bag fitted with a large open star tip.</li>
					<li>Add some drops of ube flavor/color in the remaining frosting and mix just until blended, it does not have to be completely blended or you might risk over-beating the cream and it will turn into butter. Transfer to a piping bag with a wide, flat tip.</li>
					<li> Assemble the cake, then boom!</li>
